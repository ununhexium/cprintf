# cprintf

`printf`-like with color and style support.

A sanitized `printf` alternative that also prints colors.

Actually works in `printf` style but with easy color and style specifiers.

## Examples

The quoting and escaping in these examples is assuming that you write these command in a `sh`-like shell.

For more examples, compile and check the `./demo.bash` examples.

At the time of writing these lines, Github doesn't support coloring.

You will need to either 
* checkout this repository, compile and run the [demo.sh](./demo.sh) script
* check out the Asciinema showcase, but they also have issues with the brighter colors, some styles, ...
* get a better Markdown reader

Text examples are available in the [Examples.md](./Examples.md) file.

# Specification

`cprintf` takes at least 1 argument: a format and as many arguments as necessary.

It works in the style of `printf`.

## Format

The format is a string of characters made of regular strings and placeholders.

Example: `Some text followed by a specifier {}`

## Specifiers

Specified in `{}`, rust/python style.

A specifier may contain whitespaces (` `, `\t`, ...) for an easier read.

A specifier's text and color parts may be in any order.

The specifier may contain the following information.

### A color

The color is indicated with `#`.

The color may be regular or bright.

The color is specified with different formats: code (number), single letter or word.

The color short names are based on the
RGB: `r`ed, `g`reen, `b`lue,
and CMYKW: `c`yan, `m`agenta, `y`ellow, blac`k` + `w`hite conventions.

Lower case is the normal variant, upper case is the bright variant.

#### Named colors reference table

| Name    | code | short |  long   | code bright | short bright | long bright |
|---------|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Black   |  0   |   k   |  black  |      8      |      K       |    BLACK    |
| Red     |  1   |   r   |   red   |      9      |      R       |     RED     |
| Green   |  2   |   g   |  green  |     10      |      G       |    GREEN    |
| Yellow  |  3   |   y   | yellow  |     11      |      Y       |   YELLOW    |
| Blue    |  4   |   b   |  blue   |     12      |      B       |    BLUE     |
| Magenta |  5   |   m   | magenta |     13      |      M       |   MAGENTA   |
| Cyan    |  6   |   c   |  cyan   |     14      |      C       |    CYAN     |
| White   |  7   |   w   |  white  |     15      |      W       |    WHITE    |

You can also use any hexadecimal color like brown: `#54370f`.

The usual notation applies: `#RRGGBB` in hexadecimal format.
The letters may be either lower or upper case.

The color can also be specified with the `rgb()` function.
It takes 3 parameters: red, green and blue ranging between 0 and 255 included.

#### Foreground/background

The color may be applied to either the foreground, the background or both.

Split with slash foreground over background.

`#foreground/background`

Either side is optional.

`#red` is a red font, regular background.
`#/green` is a regular font, green background.
`#red/green` is a red font, green background.
`#/` is no color, same as not specifying a color.

### A reference

Unlike `printf` where the order of arguments is forced,
`cprintf` may use arguments in any order with `%x` 
where `x` is an integer referring to the arguments passed to `cprintf`.

To use it like `printf`, do

```bash
cprintf '{} {} {}' a b c
``` 

`a b c`

To select an argument by its position, do

```bash
cprintf '{%3} {%2} {%1}' a b c
``` 

`c b a`

For clarity, it's not possible to mix index-based and positional arguments.

### A style

Supports all the styles that the ANSI escape codes allows.

A style can be specified with the long option or the short option 
`{style=bold}` or `{!bold}`.

A style can be specified with a single letter.

|  Long name  |               Alternatives               | Short name |
|:-----------:|:----------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|   strong    |                   bold                   |     s      |
|     dim     |                  faint                   |     d      |
|   italic    |                                          |     i      |
|  underline  |               underscored                |     u      |
|    blink    |                 blinking                 |     b      |
|  reversed   | inverse inversed invert inverted reverse |     r      |
|   hidden    |                invisible                 |     h      |
| crossed-out |           strike strikethrough           |     c      |

Some styles have several names.

It's possible to combine the styles.

For instance `cprintf 'foo {!italic!bold!dim!blink!strike!underline#red}' bar` for maximum visibility 🌟.

The options for the style specifiers are not case-sensitive.

The styles can be specified in many ways to help you save time. Here are a few examples of that:

```
!bold,hidden
!bold !hidden
style=bold,hidden
style=bold style=hidden
!bh
style=bh
!BH
```

#### Bold

`{!s}`
`{style=strong}`

Also accepted:

`{style=bold}`

#### Dim

`{!d}`
`{style=dim}`

Also accepted:

`{style=faint}`

#### Italic

`{!i}`
`{style=italic}`

#### Underline

`{!u}`
`{style=underline}`

Also accepted:

`{style=underscored}`

#### Blink

`{!b}`
`{style=blink}`

Also accepted:

`{style=blinking}`

#### Reversed

`{!r}`
`{style=reversed}`

Also accepted:

`{style=inverted}`
`{style=invert}`
`{style=inverse}`
`{style=inversed}`
`{style=reversed}`
`{style=reverse}`


#### Hidden

`{!h}`
`{style=hidden}`

Also accepted:

`{style=invisible}`

#### Crossed out

`{!c}`
`{style=crossed-out}`


Also accepted:

`{style=strikethrough}`
`{style=strike}`

## Multiple arguments

Use `{@}` to mean "all the args", bash-style.

`cprintf 'hello {%1} {@} {%1}' world foo`

`hello world world foo world`

The separator between the arguments defaults to space ` `.

It's also possible to specify the separator using pipes.

```bash
cprintf 'hello {%1} {@|, |} {%1}' 1 2 3 4
```

`1 1, 2, 3, 4 1`


```bash
cprintf 'hello {@|\||}' a b
```

`a|b`

It's possible to give a style to all the arguments at once using the previous specifiers.

`cprintf {all style=bold color=red}`

Will print all the arguments in red.


## Speed

```bash
hyperfine --shell=none 'target/release/cprintf "foo {!bold color=rgb(1,2,3)} bar {style=blink index=2 #k/R} baz" "Wagamama" "Sakura"'
```

```
Benchmark 1: target/release/cprintf "foo {!bold color=rgb(1,2,3)} bar {style=blink index=2 #k/R} baz" "Wagamama" "Sakura"
  Time (mean ± σ):       1.7 ms ±   0.2 ms    [User: 1.1 ms, System: 0.5 ms]
  Range (min … max):     1.1 ms …   3.3 ms    1155 runs
```

Is it fast? Is it slow? Surely fast enough to satisfy your eyes' bandwidth :)

## Size

A bit chubby.

```
ll target/release/cprintf
-rwxrwxr-x 2 uuh uuh 2,1M Okt 11 19:46 target/release/cprintf
```

## Goals

No `-` `--` `-n` `-e` etc. ambiguity as in `echo`

No `%x` and other random characters like in `printf`

No looking up for color code indexes nor figuring out which option is correct like in tput.

Useful english nouns but allow existing styles for easy migration form those tools.

Support color.

Fast! Native binary.

Format support à la printf but with modern format specifiers:

* selectors
    * positional `{}`
    * indexed `{%1}`
* styles
    * simple colors `{#red}`
    * reset to default after printing? `{#red!preserve}` or auto reset? 🤔
    * any color `{#A03472}`
    * background colors `{#white/red}`
* Styles: bold, italic, blink, reset, ... `{!bold}`
* Position on screen `{@5,10}`

## Motivation

Must be simple to start with and not trap people by default!

Must be powerful enough to not require extra tooling if it's easier, be it

* bash's number formatting trick `$(([##7]v))` for format the variable v in base 7 for instance
* printf's decimal formatting
* escape sequences or tput coloring

I'm tired of looking up color codes and have unreadable color escape sequences.

I don't want to play with `tput setaf 3` and have an unreadable echo statement.

I'm tired of looking up printf's formats, I didn't touch C for years. I use modern languages with friendlier formatting
options.

I don't want to build another layer of bash workarounds. It still contains all of echo's flaws regarding `-` `-n` `-e`
and escape sequences.

I don't want to start a real scripting language, or even worse: the JVM, to highlight a few lines of output in a bash
script.

It may as well be comprehensive so there's 1 tool that gives access to all of the shell's printing capabilities if the
format string remains terse.
I'm likely engaging on a slippery slope but we'll see if it's possible.

I don't want to import and redeclare the colors each time I use them. This should be done once and for all.

### Limitation in current tools

Mix of bash's base formatting, sprintf's decimal formatting, echo workarounds, escape sequences or tput, alternative
tool that auto-color based on various criteria

### Alternatives?

Alternatives: [zuncito](https://codeberg.org/lukaslauterbach/zuncito)
a friendly C competing implementation.

TODO: is there anything that comes close to this?

If yes list here.

### Shell / Scripts

Fish has an easy way to set a color

https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2343

https://github.com/ppo/bash-colors

https://gist.github.com/inexorabletash/9122583

## TODOs

% everything
%x single index
%x:y range
%: same as %

## Error message improvements: position hint

## Format specifiers brainstorming

All the format given below are assumed ot be enclosed in `{}`

It must be possible to easily combine the format specifiers.

Format types:

* Name 1st position
* Index `%`
* Color `#`
* Style `!`
